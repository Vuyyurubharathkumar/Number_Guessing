# Number_Guessing
This program guesses the number that the user has chosen by randomly asking the questions. This program was built using binary search algorithm approach
A while true statement is used so that the program continues executing as long as the number is found.
start_number and end_number indicates the range from 1 to 10. Initially the number checkpoint number will always be 5 as the range is 1 to 100.
if the number is guessed right the program prints the suuccessful search output otherwise based on the questions the program adds or subtracts 1 from the result.
